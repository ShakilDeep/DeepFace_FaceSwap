The provided Python script is a face-swapping application that allows users to interchange faces between two images. It leverages advanced facial recognition and image processing technologies to achieve seamless results. Upon execution, the script prompts the user to input the file paths of two images. It then loads these images using OpenCV, ensuring they are accessible and valid.

The core functionality begins with face detection, utilizing the DeepFace library with the MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) backend. DeepFace is a facial recognition and analysis framework that simplifies complex tasks like face detection, recognition, and attribute analysis. By extracting facial landmarks and bounding boxes, the script accurately identifies the facial regions in both images.

Once the faces are detected, the script extracts the facial regions based on the bounding boxes. It resizes these regions to match the dimensions of the target faces to ensure a proper fit. This resizing is crucial for maintaining the proportion and alignment of facial features during the swap.

For the face-swapping process, the script employs OpenCV's seamless cloning function. This function allows for the smooth blending of the swapped face into the target image, minimizing artifacts and ensuring that the transition between the face and the surrounding skin is natural. Masks are created for both face regions to define the areas for cloning accurately.

After the seamless cloning operation, the script saves the resulting images as 'image1_swapped.jpg' and 'image2_swapped.jpg'. These images showcase the faces from the original images swapped onto each other's positions, with a focus on realism and minimal visual discrepancies.
